# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the [latest version](https://github.com/IBM/tnz/releases/latest
) is considered for security
updates.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub
issues.**

The easiest way to report a security issue is privately through GitHub.
See [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](
https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability
) for full instructions.

Alternatively, you can report a security issue via e-mail to the
[tnz maintainers](https://github.com/IBM/tnz/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

The maintainers intend to address security vulnerabilities of medium or
higher severity within 60 days of being publicly known. Expect critical
vulnerabilities to be fixed rapidly after they are reported. Refer to
the linked [OpenSSF vulnerability response process](
https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md#apply-the-vulnerability-response-process
) for more details.
